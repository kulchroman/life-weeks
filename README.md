# 🐒 Life Weeks – A Visual Anti-Procrastination Tool

Inspired by [Tim Urban's TED Talk on procrastination](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arj7oStGLk), this minimal desktop application helps users visualize their time left until age 90 - one week at a time.

## 🚀 Features

- Simple UI: Choose your birth date and instantly see how many weeks you have left until you turn 90.
- Eye-opening: Each dot represents one week of a 90-year life - a powerful motivator to use your time wisely.
- Built with modern technologies: **Qt6**, **QML**, and **CMake** for clean cross-platform performance.

## 🧠 Motivation

> "We’re all procrastinators to some degree, but when we visualize how limited our time really is, it can push us to take action."  
> — *Inspired by Wait But Why & Tim Urban*
